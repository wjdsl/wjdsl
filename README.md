## Hi there 👋

I'm Yoon Jeong Eun!
🎭 I'm passionate about musical theater.
💻 I'm currently learning programming and building my skills in software development.
🌟 My dream is to work in the musical industry as a developer—creating apps, websites, and digital tools that support production companies and connect with audiences.
🌱 Always growing as a developer and artist at heart.
⚡ Fun fact: I dream of working at the intersection of stage and technology, bringing performances and audiences closer through digital experiences.
